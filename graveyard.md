# Project Graveyard
For my PhD, like most others, many projects have been abandoned for one reason or another. Most often, either data limitations or the size of the contribution cause me to refocus my effort into new ideas. It has always upset me that we hide these projects, mainly because others will likely consider or try a similar idea and they could use more information. Either they can see why it didn't work out for me or they can take the data to pursue their own project. If you'd like access to any of the data I used, email me.
