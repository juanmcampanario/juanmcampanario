# Project Graveyard
For my PhD, like most others, many projects have been abandoned for one reason or another. Most often, either data limitations or the size of the contribution cause me to refocus my effort into new ideas. It has always upset me that we hide these projects, mainly because others will likely consider or try a similar idea and they could use more information. Either they can see why it didn't work out for me or they can take the data to pursue their own project. If you'd like access to any of the data I used, email me.

### School Board Elections and Superintendents
There are many papers on how school boards effect school outcomes. School board responsibilities include setting a vision and goals for their public schools, approving textbooks and other curriculum materials, and hiring a superintendent. This idea centers on the superintendent, as they're akin to CEO of the schools. Superintendents are the ones overseeing day-to-day operations, they recruit teachers and principals, and they are responsible for evaluating employees with duties related to tenure and termination. 

The questions I was most interested in asking were whether the racial composition of the school board influenced the decisions.

### The Digital Divide and Consequences of Computer-Based Testing
This project started out of interest in learning and reading about the experiences of English Langauge Learners (EL), i.e. K-12 students in the US that did not speak English. I started with reading academic papers that were estimating differences in test scores by mode of instruction, which then moved to reading more about reclassification into mainstream classrooms. I learned that in the past few years, most states have transitioned to administering the test via computer as opposed to hand-written tests. From an administrative and grading persepective, this is a cost saving move, but what if students are not able to use the technology or typing slows them down, or even they make more mistakes when typing? I decided to test to see if switching from paper to computer hurts students. 

Most people working in this space use administrative records, accessing individual test scores. I am not in a position to attain such data so instead I looked for a state that had recently changed the test medium and had average test scores available at the school-grade level. The data is available for Connecticut, luckily I went grew up in Danbury, CT so I was also able to ask local EL teachers about their experiences teaching to better understand the context. In CT, all schools were forced to switch by the 2017-2018 academic year, but schools were able to switch earlier. Identifying an effect in this setting can be done by exploiting the staggered adoption of computer based testing. However, a few problems arise.

* According to an education consultant in the Bureau of Student Assessment for CT's Department of Ed, there is not a list of when schools switched or a reason why.
   * The first point can be overcome by emailing the person responsible for EL students in each district or school, but that would be quite labor intensive.
   * The second point is very problematic as it implies that schools might select into switching before the deadline in a way that is unobservable and correlated with student achievement. For example, imagine the only reason schools switch earlier is if there are enough computers in a computer-lab for all the students to take the test at the same time. These schools are likely better funded and have more resources, and EL students may use computers more often in these schools for other activities or even during test prep. Therefore, comparing their test scores when switching from paper to computer to students in other schools would bias the estimate towards a null result.
