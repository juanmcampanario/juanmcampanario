Welcome to my website. 

3 types of things are available here: [passion projects](/passion.md), [academic projects](/academic.md), and [abandoned projects](/graveyard.md).

# About Me
Aside from projects, I like to stay active. I played tennis, mainly doubles, in high school and still play on occassion. I've moved to more solo activities during graduate school, such as [lifting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Py-m6hXzad2FyPXVIZnuGSjOb-RmlTHB/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/34312248){:target="_blank"}.
