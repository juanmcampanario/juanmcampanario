# About Me
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. I am passionate about quantitative analysis, with a specific interest in causal and reduced form work. My dissertation focuses on health and economic development. I also have some short-lived assignments on tax assessments, education, and housing vouchers, some of which is featured in the abandoned projects section. Aside from projects, I like to stay active. I played tennis, mainly doubles, in high school and still play on occassion. I've moved to more solo activities during graduate school, such as lifting and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/34312248){:target="_blank"}.
