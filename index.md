# Spotlight
While writing code for my dissertation, I "discovered" this trend in reported birth dates in Peru's Live Birth Registry. More to come.

# About Me
I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Pittsburgh and my BA from the University of Connecticut. I am passionate about quantitative analysis, with a specific interest in causal and reduced form work. My dissertation focuses on health and economic development, which you can find [here](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/44976/){:target="_blank"}. I also have some short-lived assignments on tax assessments, education, and housing vouchers, some of which is featured in the abandoned projects section. Aside from projects, I like to stay active. I played tennis, mainly doubles, in high school and still play on occassion. I've moved to more solo activities during graduate school, such as lifting weights and running.
