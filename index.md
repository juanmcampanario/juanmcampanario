Welcome to my website. 

3 things can be found here: [academic works](/academic.md), [side projects](/side.md), and [abandoned projects](/graveyard.md).

# About Me
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. I love data and quantitative analysis, with a specific interest in causal and reduced form work. My dissertation focuses on issues related to mining activities, both historic and present, in Peru (I am not Peruvian). I have also attempted policy relevant research in US contexts, with short-lived assignments on tax assessments, education, and housing vouchers, some of which is featured in the abandoned projects section. Aside from projects, I like to stay active. I played tennis, mainly doubles, in high school and still play on occassion. I've moved to more solo activities during graduate school, such as lifting and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/34312248){:target="_blank"}.
