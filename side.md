# Side Projects
During my limited free time, I enjoy creating new datasets and highlighting new insights about topics. 

### MMA Fights
During the pandemic, I started to watch a lot of UFC events. I realized that there wasn't really any time series data. Most statistics would be about individual fighters, telling us about their personal records. I decided I wanted to change that. I wrote a script to scrape [Sherdog](https://www.sherdog.com){:target="_blank"} tables related to all fighters. Sherdog has data on all professional fighters, with tables recording information about fights during their careers. For example, on [Daniel Cormier's page](https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Daniel-Cormier-52311){:target="_blank"}, we know the opponent, the event, the date, the result, how the fight ended, the duration, and the referee for each of his professional fights.

### Forecasting Demand for Neonatal & Maternal Services 
Understanding how demand for services change over time is essential to policy makers. Whether it be polling stations, bus stops, or hospital services, predicting which locations will see the largest growth in demand allows policy makers to direct funds to areas that will be most in need. In this short project, I focus on the demand for neonatal and maternal services.
