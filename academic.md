### Air Quality and Infant Health: Closing La Oroya's Metallurgical Complex
*Abstract*: La Oroya, Peru has suffered from poor air quality since the early 1920s. In 2009, the
refining and smelting operation responsible for environmental degradation unexpectedly closed. Using a difference in differences approach, I show infant health worsened during the closure. Birth weights fell by an average of 60 grams, relative to infants born upwind the complex, and women experienced slightly shorter gestational periods. Birth weights fell for those born in publicly funded hospitals but not those in private hospitals. The negative consequences were concentrated in infants who mothers were less educated, and infants born to migrants or non-migrant experienced statistically similar reductions.

### The Influence of Colonial Institutions during Economic Booms and Distributional Policies (with Jorge Ag&uuml;ero)
*Abstract*: Many studies have documented long-lasting negative effects of colonial institutions. Yet, little is known about whether there are current policies reducing those impacts. We focus on the *mita*, a forced labor system implemented in 1573 and abolished in 1812 in Peru. Prior work has shown large penalties for living with the area at the beginning of the 21st century. We find that in the last two decades, characterized by an economic boom, the negative effects of the mita have worsen. However, the creation of cash transfer programs targeting the poorest households nationwide, has eliminated the *mita*â€™s effects among the ultra-poor.
