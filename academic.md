### Air Quality and Infant Health: Closing La Oroya's Metallurgical Complex
*Abstract*: This paper estimates the effect of temporary closure of La Oroya's Metallurgical Complex on infant health. Using Peru's Live Birth Registry, I exploit the unanticipated closure of the infamous refinery and compare the incidence of low birth weights and premature births of infants born downwind the complex to those born upwind. I find the closure had no effect on the incidence of low birth weights or premature births, but had a small negative effect on total birth weight. Heterogeneity analysis shows that infants born to mothers with low levels of education experienced a 5% reduction in the incidence of low birth weights.

### The Influence of Colonial Institutions during Economic Booms and Distributional Policies (with Jorge Ag&uuml;ero)
*Abstract*: Many studies have documented long-lasting negative effects of colonial institutions. Yet, little is known about whether there are current policies reducing those impacts. We focus on the *mita*, a forced labor system implemented in 1573 and abolished in 1812 in Peru. Prior work has shown large penalties for living with the area at the beginning of the 21st century. We find that in the last two decades, characterized by an economic boom, the negative effects of the mita have worsen. However, the creation of cash transfer programs targeting the poorest households nationwide, has eliminated the *mita*â€™s effects among the ultra-poor.
